data with so large  traditional data management tools can store it or process it

5 V's of BigData
Volume:  This refers to the sheer quantity of data, which is typically enormous. It can range 
from terabytes to petabytes and even exabytes of data
Velocity: This refers to the speed at which new data is generated and the speed at which data 
moves around. With the growth of the Internet and smart devices, data is being generated 
continuously, in real time, from various sources.
    - Real time (Streams) (bank transaciton, social media)
    - Near time (taking some buffer window)
    - Batch (when real time is not needed then use batch) (always have clearcut use case from )
