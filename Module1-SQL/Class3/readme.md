### Optimized Query

An optimized query minimizes execution time and resource usage by efficiently processing data. Key factors include:

- **Execution Time**: The duration required to execute a query. Efficient queries are designed to minimize this time by reducing the complexity and number of operations.
  
- **Cost of Execution**: Refers to the computational resources (CPU, memory, I/O) required to run the query. Optimized queries reduce the cost by minimizing resource-intensive operations.
  
- **Amount of Data to Process**: Optimized queries limit the amount of data processed at each stage to avoid unnecessary computations and reduce the workload.

### Comparison of `HAVING` vs. Subquery

- **Subquery Version**: Processes rows twiceâ€”first in the subquery to generate the list of countries with a count of 1, and then in the outer query to filter the main dataset. This leads to higher execution time and cost due to redundant processing.

  ```sql
  SELECT country 
  FROM orders_data 
  WHERE country IN (
      SELECT country 
      FROM orders_data 
      GROUP BY country 
      HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
  );
  ```

- **`HAVING` Clause Version**: Directly groups and filters rows in a single step. This approach is more efficient because it reduces the number of operations and avoids redundant processing.

  ```sql
  SELECT country 
  FROM orders_data 
  GROUP BY country 
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;
  ```

**Summary**: The `HAVING` clause is generally more optimized than the subquery approach because it consolidates grouping and filtering into a single operation, reducing execution time, cost, and the amount of data processed.

In SQL, conditions like `1=1` and `1=0` are often used as placeholder conditions or for specific logical control in queries.

### `1=1` in SQL
- **Use Case:** 
  - **Placeholder Condition:** `WHERE 1=1` is commonly used as a placeholder in dynamically generated SQL queries. For instance, when building queries programmatically, `1=1` allows you to easily append additional conditions using `AND` without worrying about whether the `WHERE` clause already exists.
  - **Example in Sqoop:**
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 1=1 AND department='HR';
    ```
    Here, `1=1` makes it easy to add more conditions programmatically without modifying the basic query structure.

### `1=0` in SQL
- **Use Case:**
  - **Condition That Always Fails:** `WHERE 1=0` is used when you want to return no rows, often for testing or to create a table structure without copying data.
  - **Example:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE temp AS SELECT * FROM employees WHERE 1=0;
    ```
    This query creates a `temp` table with the same structure as `employees` but without any data.

These conditions are useful in query building, testing, and controlling the flow of data selection, especially in tools like Sqoop where SQL is dynamically constructed.
